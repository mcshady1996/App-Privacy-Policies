# Rick McFadden — Watch Face App Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-11-09

This Privacy Policy explains how Rick McFadden ("I", "me", "my", or "Developer") collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you install or use the watch face app (the "App"). The App is provided by Rick McFadden. By using the App you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

If you do not agree with this policy, please do not install or use the App.

1. What information I collect

I limit the information collected to what is necessary for the App to work and to improve it. Types of information that may be collected include:

- Information you provide directly
  - Support requests or feedback you send by email, which may include your name and email address if you provide them.
  - Optional preferences you set inside the App (for example, visual themes or custom complications).

- Device and usage information (automatically collected)
  - Device model, operating system version, App version, and unique device identifiers (e.g., advertising identifier or platform-specific ID) used for diagnostics and analytics.
  - Usage data such as how often you open the watch face, which features you use, and crash logs to help me improve stability and performance.

- Sensor, health, and location data
  - The App does not collect health, biometric, or precise location data by default. If a future App feature requires sensor/health/location data, I will clearly disclose that in the App and request explicit permission before collecting such data. Any sensitive data collection will be optional and only used for the feature requested.

2. How I use the information

I use the information I collect for the following purposes:

- To provide and maintain the App and its features.
- To detect, diagnose, and fix technical problems (via crash reports and diagnostics).
- To analyze usage patterns and improve the App.
- To respond to your support requests, questions, or feedback.
- To send important updates about the App (e.g., changes to functionality or this Privacy Policy) if you have provided contact information.

3. Legal basis for processing (where applicable)

If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, the legal basis for processing may include your consent, fulfilling a contract (providing the App), and my legitimate interests in improving and securing the App.

4. Sharing and disclosure

I will not sell your personal information.

I may share information in the following limited circumstances:

- Service providers: I may engage third-party service providers (such as analytics, crash-reporting, or hosting providers) who process data on my behalf and under my instruction. These providers are contractually required to protect your information and may only use it for the services they perform for me.
- Legal requirements: I may disclose information if required by law, court order, or to respond to lawful requests from public authorities.
- Business transfers: If the App or related assets are transferred or sold, user information may be transferred as part of that transaction. You will be notified if your information is part of such a transfer.

5. Third-party services and SDKs

The App may use third-party SDKs or services (for example, analytics or crash-reporting frameworks). These third parties may collect data as described in their own privacy policies. I do not control those third parties’ collection or use of your data. Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Crash reporting and analytics (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics, Google Analytics for Firebase) — if used, only aggregated or pseudonymized data is collected for performance and stability improvements.

If particular third-party services are used in a release, that list will be included in an in-app "About" or a release notes entry.

6. Data retention

I retain collected information only for as long as necessary to provide the App and its features, to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Usage and diagnostic data are typically retained in aggregated or anonymized form.

7. Your choices and rights

- Access and correction: If you provided personal information (for example, via email), you can contact me to request access, correction, or deletion of that information.
- Opt-out: You can uninstall the App to stop any future data collection from the App on that device. For analytics or advertising opt-out, refer to your device settings (e.g., reset advertising identifier or opt out of interest-based ads) where available.
- Data portability and deletion: Where required by law (for example, GDPR or CCPA), you may request a copy of your personal data or request deletion. To make such requests, contact me using the contact details below and provide sufficient information to locate the data.

8. Security

I take reasonable technical and organizational measures to help protect information collected from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. However, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable. Please use secure practices and avoid sharing sensitive information via unsupported channels.

9. Children’s privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the applicable minimum age in your country). I do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided me with personal information without parental consent, please contact me and I will take steps to delete such information.

10. International transfers

The App and any third-party services I use may store and process information in the United States or other countries. By using the App, you consent to the transfer of information to countries that may have different data protection standards than your country.

11. California residents (CCPA)

If you are a California resident, you may have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), including the right to request disclosure of categories of personal information collected, the right to request deletion of personal information, and the right to opt out of the sale of personal information. The App does not sell personal information.

12. Changes to this privacy policy

I may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. When I make material changes I will provide notice by updating the Effective Date at the top of this policy and, where reasonably possible, notify users via the App or via the contact method you provided.

13. Contact

This Privacy Policy is a general template. Depending on your App’s actual behavior (for example, if you implement ads, user accounts, health data collection, or use specific third-party SDKs), you should tailor this policy accordingly and consider legal review to ensure compliance with applicable laws and store requirements (Google Play, Apple App Store, etc.).
